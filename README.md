## Setup
- Git clone this project in your parent folder (where you want the project's new folder to be created) with:
```
git clone git@github.com:mxng/radio-station.git
```


## Usage
Have the [liveshare](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare) extension (if you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) installed and run it with Live Share

Your default browser should run the file with a new tab page.

Feel free to click the radios in the list after that.
